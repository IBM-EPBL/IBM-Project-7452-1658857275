PROJECT DESCRIPTION
Handwritten digit recognition has recently been of very interest among the researchers because of the evolution of various Machine Learning, Deep Learning and Computer Vision algorithms. This is higly useful in finding the numbers that are written using hands. The illegible handwritten digits are converted to their respective digits.
